# Whack-A-Mole


This is the first game I made without prompt or example to go by, I got the inspiration from a whack'a'mole toy i had gotten my son for his birthday years back, I saw it and thought it would be a good game to create.

The most difficult part i ran into was the loading times of the images used, the game would start and often the images were not loaded in time, after a bit of looking up I found the solution by posing the question onto stack overflow, someone replyied with a clue and i mangaed to figure out what was going on, i fixed it by loading all images in a method first and saving what i could as one big picture to load as one image, this was done for the start and playing screen aswell as the end screen.


THE GAME

the simple game of whack'a'mole, press start at the start screen, the game will load you will hear and see the mole hills rumble up from the ground, a countdown begins and the first of ten rounds starts.

using the mouse and left click the aim is to shoot as many moles as possible, 30 seconds per round, ten rounds.  the speed of the moles popping there heads up and down will increase with every round, the smaller the mole (ones at top) the more points you will get for shooting them! the score will increase for each mole as the rounds progress. get to the end of the last round to enter your initials and see if you can make it on to the scoreboard Top 3 only.  good luck.
